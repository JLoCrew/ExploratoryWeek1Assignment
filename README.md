# ExploratoryWeek1Assignment
My submission for assigment 1, week 1 for Exploratory Analysis class

This directory includes four .r files that contain actual codes to produce four different graphs:
- a histogram
- a line graph with one y-variable and time as x-variable
- a line graph with multiple y-variables and time as x-variable
- a plot with four graphs

The original data source is energy consumption data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository

A subset of data was extracted for this analysis; specifically, data from Feb-01-2007 to Feb-02-2007.  A new variable called "newtimedate" was also created
